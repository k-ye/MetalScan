# MetalScan

Blelloch's exclusive scan implemented in Metal

I haven't figured out yet how to run the unit tests for a static library that uses Metal. (When I did that, I failed at making a new `MTLLibrary` from device.) Therefore this is done as an app. 

To use the exclusive scan functionality, just copy `ExclusiveScan.swift` and `Scan.metal` to your own project.
